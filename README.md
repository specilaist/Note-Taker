# Note-Taker

App that lets user create, view, store and delete notes:
I was able to make a get request to the initial db.json file.
I established routes for getting and posting data.

## Issues

I wasn't able to make the app work the way I wanted. I could make a get request, but could not do a post or delete request.
For some reason the "router.post" function could not link to the "db.json" path.
I might need to require the "path" component into the index.js file in order to make it work better.
