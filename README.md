# Note-Taker

App that lets user create, view, store and delete notes:
I was able to make a get request to the initial db.json file.
I established routes for getting and posting data.

## Issues

* The app works on localhost:3001 but doesn't work quite well on the heroku deployment

* I could make a get request, and a post request and a delete request
      * The delete request took a little work, but I figured it out with a filter function.
      * The routes work very well when using Postman
      * All the requests work on localhost:3001, but they require the website to be reloaded in order to see the changes

## For Later

* I would like to make the page more dynamic. I could use React and state in order to make the pages render better.
